Notes and background research.

# Motivation:
"In the past decades, numerous methods for handling a single mode of variability, such as pose or illumination, have been proposed and examined. But much less work has been devoted to simultaneously handling multiple modes of variation, according to a recent survey [52].3 In other words, although a method might successfully deal with one type of variation, it quickly breaks down when moderate amounts of other variations are introduced to face images."
