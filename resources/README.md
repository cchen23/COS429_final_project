## Datasets.
- Cartoon Faces: “CartoonFaces.” Accessed December 11, 2017. http://cvit.iiit.ac.in/research/projects/cvit-projects/cartoonfaces.
  - Note: Images labeled with bounding boxes. Probably should crop actual faces before putting through face recognition algorithm. (http://cvit.iiit.ac.in/images/Projects/cartoonFaces/IIIT-CFWfiles/README.txt)
- FERET: https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/image-group/color-feret-database
  - Note: Need to request access (DONE: 2017-12-16).
