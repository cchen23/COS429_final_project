## Algorithms
- [x] Framework for implementation + testing.
- [ ] Add code to save results (and model?)

- [x] Eigenfaces PCA (Turk and Pentland 1991)
- [x] Sparse representation (eqn 1.4, face_chapter)
- [ ] Combined l1 minimization (eqn 1.9, face_chapter)

Other possible ideas: (from http://www.face-rec.org/algorithms/)
- LDA
- EP
- Bayesian Framework
- SVM
- Hidden Markov Model
- Elastic Bunch Graph Matching (faces as graphs)
- Boosting

- Deformable SRC? (Algorithm 1.1, face_chapter)

- [ ] Add stuff with timing.

## Manipulations

- [ ] Rotations.
- [ ] Flipping.
- [ ] Illumination.
- [ ] Cartoon Faces.

## Written
- [ ] Algorithm performance.
    - [ ] Baseline.
    - [ ] With our manipulations.
    - [ ] With cartoon faces.
- [ ] Algorithm runtime.
